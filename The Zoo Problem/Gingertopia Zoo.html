        <li>Ollie</li>
        <dd>
          A fuzzy boi with a big temper. Feeding time is 6AM, 12PM and 6PM. Miss
          any of them and Ollie will go feral. He only accepts pets if he has
          been fed, otherwise your arm will be a snack.
        </dd>
        <li>Mona</li>
        <dd>
          The sweetest girl that loves to nap. To her every season is
          hibernation season. She is just like Ollie when it comes to being fed,
          although she will get far more violent if a feeding time is missed.

        <li>Frankie</li>
        <dd>
          This animal is one of a kind and has a very chaotic personality. This
          guy once took a hat off a vistor and tossed it to Coconut. The hat was
          not recovered.
        </dd>
        <li>Coconut</li>
        <dd>
          Nobody knows who named a giraffe Coconut, but strangely it's pretty
          fitting. We don't know how he keeps doing it, but Coconut keeps
          finding himself in high places where he will intentionally fall. We
          think he does this for attention.

      <dl>
        <li>Mella</li>
        <dd>
          The star of the whole zoo! Mella is our most frequently visited animal
          at the zoo and she <em>loves</em> the attention! Mella can often be
          seen interacting with the little kids that get up close to the
          protective glass.
        </dd>
        <li>Karl</li>
        <dd>
          The sassiest lion we have ever rescued by a long mile. Visitor love
          coming to see Karl because there is no telling what he could be up to
          on any given day. One day he was yeeting himself into the pond
          repeatedly and the next day he was playing fetch by himself with some
          stray branches. We love Karl.

      <dl>
        <li>Cookie</li>
        <dd>
          This little rascal is an escape artist and a damn good one at that.
          Several times a day we have to chase Cookie around to get him back in
          the enclosure, but have you tried catching a wild monkey? It's near
          impossible.
        </dd>
        <li>Earl</li>
        <dd>
          Much like Karl the Lion, Earl is a wildcard and is the most erratic
          animal in the entire zoo. We have had numerous reports of Earl yeeting
          bananas at people then screaming like a banshee.
        </dd>
        <li>Banana Pudding</li>
        <dd>
          We think whoever named Coconut probably named this monkey. Probably
          the most beloved monkey in the zoo, Banana Pudding is the calmest
          animal we have here. She doesn't do much, but on numerous occassions
          we have seen her teaching sign language to kids.

      <dl>
        <li>Wren</li>
        <dd>
          We here at Gingertopia Zoo have a soft spot for the Alligators and
          Wren is one of our personal favorites. Extremely docile and calm, Wren
          loves to cuddle up in the laps of our Zoo Pros and take a nap. She
          once napped with a Zoo Pro for 4 hours without so much and stirring.
        </dd>
        <li>Aspen</li>
        <dd>
          Much like Wren, Aspen loves to nap but she prefers a nice shady spot
          underneath a tree. While Aspen is extremely friendly to all guests and
          Zoo Pros, she prefers to spend her time teasing Mika or observing the
          visitors from underneath her favorite tree.
        </dd>
        <li>Mika</li>
        <dd>
          Probably the friendliest animal in the entire Zoo, Mika loves to get
          up close and personal with visitors and will sometimes let children
          pet her. One of Mika's favorite activities is to greet the visitors
          face-to-face, with Zoo Pros supervising of course.
